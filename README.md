**Retail Sales Analysis**

This project is an end-to-end exploratory data analysis of a retail sales dataset using MySQL and Power BI, focused on building strong fundamentals in data analysis rather than heavy modeling or advanced DAX. The dataset was first loaded into MySQL, where core EDA queries were written to understand sales trends, category performance, customer behavior, and overall business metrics using aggregations, filtering, and grouping. To complement the SQL analysis, the same dataset was imported into Power BI via Excel to design a basic, clean dashboard using only native visuals and simple fields, avoiding DAX to keep the focus on data understanding and visualization logic. The Power BI report presents key insights such as sales distribution by category, revenue trends over time, and product-level performance in an intuitive, business-friendly format. This project demonstrates my ability to work across the full analytics workflow - from raw data exploration in SQL to insight communication through dashboards - and serves as a foundational portfolio project highlighting analytical thinking, structured querying, and visualization skills.

2) How many unique customers have made purchases?

3) What is the total revenue generated across all transactions?

4) What is the average revenue per transaction?

5) What is the total quantity of products sold?

6) How does total revenue vary across different product categories?

7) Which product categories have the highest and lowest sales volume (units sold)?

8) What is the average unit price for each product category?

9) How do monthly sales trends change over time?

10) Which months record the highest and lowest total revenue?

11) How does revenue distribution differ by customer gender?

12) What is the average quantity purchased per transaction?

13) Which product categories contribute the most to overall revenue percentage-wise?

14) Is there a noticeable relationship between unit price and quantity sold?

15) What is the revenue contribution of each category over time (monthly breakdown)?
